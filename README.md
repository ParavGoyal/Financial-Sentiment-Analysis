# Financial-Sentiment-Analysis
Introduction:
Sentiment analysis on finance is the process of using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze the emotions and opinions expressed in financial news articles, social media posts, and other textual data related to the finance industry. The primary goal of sentiment analysis on finance is to identify whether the overall sentiment towards a particular financial asset, such as a stock or currency, is positive, negative, or neutral.

Methodology:
The project will be divided into the following steps:
1. Data Collection: A large dataset of financial news articles and social media posts related to the finance industry will be collected from various sources such as financial news websites, social media platforms, and financial blogs.
2. Data Preprocessing: The collected data will be preprocessed by removing stop words, stemming, and lemmatization. The preprocessed data will be tokenized, and each token will be assigned a numerical value to represent it.
3. Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines can be used to train the sentiment analysis model on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data. In this project we have decided to XGBClassifier for training purposes
4. Model Evaluation: The performance of the trained model will be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy.
